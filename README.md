3/13/24 - Remote Control & Color Sensor
Implemented to go north, south and pick up grandma. Currently implementing color sensor.
Update: Added color sensor identification. Robot can now go through the maze and stop at certain colors. 

3/18/24 - Touch Sensor 
Currently adding touch sensor to be able to detect walls so robot can make turns accordingly.
In addition, working on navigation.

3/20/24 - Coding Navigation Cont. from 3/18/24
Implementing code to navigate EV3 robot to make turns and follow right side of the wall. The ultrasonic sensor senses wall by about 7-12 feet in distance so it is able to use the wall as a guide to go through the maze. Ended the class finally figuring out how to navigate around a structure without hitting it.

3/25 & 3/27 - Finalizing color sensor

Added color sensor to navigation code and was able to make it stop at certain colors. Stoping at red for a second and made it beep for blue and green. Iterations are being made to make the robot run smoother, and more efficiently. Demo will be linked below.

4/1/24 - 4/3/24 - Addition of new touch sensor and use of bigger tires

Added big tired instead of small ones. Changing the tires helped immensely with navigation and turning. Turns have become quick and smooth as oppposed to the small tires we had before. Also added a new touch sensor which also helps with navigating through the maze. If left or right touch sensor is hit, it will back up and turn left. Small tires with the addition of the touch sensor gives a bigger surface to be be hit which enables us to navigate more efficiently. It does look like a fighter robot but we are contantly iterating through the design to make it better and better. 

Funny thing but we thought the entire maze had to be run through autonomously but we found out that we can move the robot at designated colors at green and blue. We only need the robot to be autonomous whhile it navigates through the maze. Making sure it stops at red, etc etc...
