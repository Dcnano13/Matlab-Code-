3/13/24 - Remote Control & Color Sensor
Implemented to go north, south and pick up grandma. Currently implementing color sensor.
Update: Added color sensor identification. Robot can now go through the maze and stop at certain colors. 

3/18/24 - Touch Sensor 
Currently adding touch sensor to be able to detect walls so robot can make turns accordingly.
In addition, working on navigation.

3/20/24 - Coding Navigation Cont. from 3/18/24
Implementing code to navigate EV3 robot to make turns and follow right side of the wall. The ultrasonic sensor senses wall by about 7-12 feet in distance so it is able to use the wall as a guide to go through the maze. Ended the class finally figuring out how to navigate around a structure without hitting it.

3/25 & 3/27 - Finalizing color sensor
Added color sensor to navigation code and was able to make it stop at certain colors. Stoping at red for a second and made it beep for blue and green.
